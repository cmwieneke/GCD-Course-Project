There is one script for this project and it is completely in the run_analysis.R file.

The script:

Reads in the raw txt files and creates a single data frame named all

Next the code extracts the variables that are either a mean or standard deviation

Descriptive activity names are then added

Variables are then labeled appropriately with descriptive names

Finally a tidy dataset is created by taking the mean of Subject and Activity for each of the variables and then exported
